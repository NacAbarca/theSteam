Hi!

Thank you for purchasing our theme on ThemeForest! Here are a few steps that will help you setup your theme to look like you saw on the demo page!

Steps:

1) Activate The Steam plugin
2) In the admin panel, go to
	Appearance > Theme Settings > General (Tab)
	Click on "Import" and wait for the import process to finalize.

	!!! If import fails, this most likely happened because you need to increase php max_execution_time !!!

	If you can't increase max_execution_time, simply press Import multiple times until all data is imported!

3) In the admin panel, go to
	Settings > Reading
	Front page displays - Select "A static page"
	From the dropdown menu, for Front page select "TheSteam Front Page"

That's all!
